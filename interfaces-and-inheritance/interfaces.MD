# Interfaces

## ðŸ“Œ Interfaces in Java
1. An interface is a reference type, similar to a class that can contain **only** constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods and nested types. 
2. Interfaces cannot be instantiated - they can only be implemented by classes and extended by ohter interfaces.
3. Note that an interface can extend any number of interfaces. The interface declaration can include a comma-separated list of all the interfaces that it extends.

### The Interface Body
The interface body can contain **abstract methods, default methods and static methods**. All of these methods in an interface are **implicitly** `public`, `static`, and `final`.
