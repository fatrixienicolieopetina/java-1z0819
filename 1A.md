### 1A. Use primitives and wrapper classes, including, operators, parentheses, type promotion and casting

#### üìå Java Wrapper Classes
Wrapper classes are object representations of primitive data types. They are used to represent primitives when an `Object` is required. Placing primitive types into wrapper classes is called **BOXING**. The reverse, i.e. from wrapper object to primitive is called **UNBOXING**

Performance-wise, primitives are faster than their boxed counterparts. 

The table below shows the primitive types with their `Wrapper` classes.

|Primitive Type | Wrapper Class | Constructor Arguments|
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
|`byte` | `Byte` | byte or String |
|`short` | `Short` | short or String |
|`int` | `Integer` | int or String |
|`long` | `Long` | long or String |
|`float` | `Float` | float, double or String |
|`double` | `Double` | double or String |
|`char` | `Character` | char |
|`boolean` | `Boolean` | boolean or String |

#### üìå Java Boxing/Unboxing

```java
    // Boxing
    Integer i  = new Integer(8);
    
    //Unboxing
    int i2 = i.intValue();
```
**Boxing** . Primitive values, like `int`, `boolean` are converted to associated wrapper `Object`. 

**Unboxing**. Wrapper objects are converted to primitive values, i.e. `int`, `boolean` 

#### üìåJava Autoboxing
Java 5 introduced autoboxing. Autoboxing/unboxing means automatic conversion of primitives to objects or vice versa, when needed. 
It can happen during _assignments_, _passing parameters to methods_, _returning values from methods_, _variable comparisons_, _arithmetic operations_, and _others_.  
For example,
```java
   /*
   * 10 is a primitive int. It is autoboxed and saved to i of type Integer Object
   */
   Integer i = 10;
   
   // Auto unboxing happens here
   int j = i;
```

#### üìå Object Interning
Object interning is keeping only one copy of every distinct Java object. The object must be immutable. These objects are stored in an **_INTERN POOL_** . In Java, when primitive values are boxed into a wrapper object, the values are interned, and any boxing conversions  of these values are guaranteed to result in the same object.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Notes :
1. Primitive data types cannot be placed in Java Collections. The primitive values should be boxed first before putting them in a collection.
2. Java **DOES NOT** support operator overloading. When arithmetic operations are performed on wrapper objects, automatic boxing/unboxing is done by the compiler. _[i should think about this ü§î]_
