### Handle text using String and StringBuilder classes

#### ðŸ“Œ Strings
1. The String class has 13 constructors that allows you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources.
2. The String class is immutable. The String class provides a number of method that seemingly modifies the string object. However, what it really does is create a new String as a result of the operation.
3. `Charsequence` is an interface that is implemented by the `String` class. Therefore, a string can be used as an argument for `contains`.

#### ðŸ“Œ Converting between Numbers and Strings
1. The `Number` subclasses (`Byte`, `Integer`, `Double`, etc) provides a class method `valueOf` that converts a string to an object of that type.
2. Each of the `Number` subclass also provides a `parseXXX` method that converts string to their primitive counterparts.
